    "This notebook provides a quick introduction to the main features of the **netrics** package. This package is registered on PyPi, with a GitHub repository at https://github.com/bryangraham/netrics. This package provides an implementation of the _tetrad logit_ and _joint logit fixed effects_ estimators introduced in Graham (2014).\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "The **netrics** package has the following dependencies: numpy, scipy, itertools, pandas, numba and numexpr. These are standard libraries and are included in most scientific Python distributions. For example they are included in the highly recommended Anaconda distribution of Python. If you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, then you can follow the (straightforward but tedious) instructions here to learn how install the netrics package from PyPi and make it available in Anaconda using the \"conda\" package manager. For users who anticipate only infrequent use, permanent installation of the **netrics** package may not be worth the trouble. One possibility is to just clone (ie., copy) the GitHub repository https://github.com/bryangraham/netrics, which contains the latest version of **netrics**. Then append the path pointing to the location of the package on your local machine to your sys directory. This is what is done in the next snippet of code."

The *dyad\\_jfe\\_logit()* function implements this estimator. By default if reports the iterated bias-corrected estimates described in the paper (but the uncorrected estimates are also returned by the function).

    "It takes some time for *dyad\\_jfe\\_logit()* to converge (even with the carefully chosen starting values). This reflects the sparsity of the Nyakatoke network and the consequent difficulty of estimating the household degree heterogeneity effects.\n",

    "Relative to the *tetrad\\_logit()* results, the joint estimator suggests sorting by religion and clan. In Monte Carlo experiments I have found that the joint estimator -- particularly the bias correction step -- can work very poorly in networks like the Nyakatoke one (i.e., in networks that are sparse such that many agents have only a few links). In such settings the $A_{i}$ for $i=1,...,N$ may be _very_ imprecisely estimated and this can effect the quality of the common parameter estimates as well.\n",

    "For reference we can look at the joint coefficient estimates prior to bias correction using the *print\\_coef()* utility included in the **netrics** package. These point estimates are closer to the *tetrad\\_logit()* ones than their bias-corrected counterparts. This suggests, that in this particular example, bias-correction may be doing more harm that good.\n",

    "Monte Carlo evidence suggests that in denser networks, the size distortion causes by bias in the limit distribution of the joint fixed effects estimator is very real and, furthermore, that bias correction can be effective in such contexts. So not too much should be made of this example."
